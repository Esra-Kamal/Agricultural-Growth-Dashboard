# 🌾 Agricultural Growth Bar Chart – QuickViz Challenge

## 📊 Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for the **Raise the Bar – QuickViz Challenge** by Microsoft Fabric.

The project presents a **Power BI bar chart** that visualizes agricultural growth trends across multiple crop groups over several years, using open-source data from GitHub.  
The objective of this QuickViz challenge is to communicate insights using **a single, impactful visual** with clean design and meaningful comparison.
